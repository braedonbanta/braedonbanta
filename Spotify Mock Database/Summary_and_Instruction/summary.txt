Instructions:

To test and access all queries in our database / website implementation, select different areas or features from the nav menu and go through each hyperlink listed. 
For example, clicking on USERS will show the features associated with that area, like DISPLAY ALL USERS, or FOLLOW ANOTHER USER. In order to make this process efficient, 
the user should select the DISPLAY features in each category (if they are there) so that they can see the information needed to use the other queries. 
An example of this would be for trying the DISPLAY SONGS FROM AN ARTIST in the ARTISTS area, the user would be best advised to use the DISPLAY ALL SONGS feature 
in the SONGS area so they can see the artists that exist in the database (artists being a column that gets displayed).

In general, this rule exists for all queries that would need ‘pre-existing’ knowledge: the information is all accessible from the front-end. No need to look in the 
MySQL tables to use the front-end to its full extent.
